# Production Level Inventory Display Refactor - Project Plan

## üéØ **Project Overview**

This project refactors the Production Level inventory display system to provide a more intuitive, visual, and integrated user experience. The current alert-based system will be replaced with visual indicators directly on Production Job cards, and jobs will be displayed horizontally for better space utilization.

## üìã **User Requirements**

Based on user specifications:

1. **Visual Resource Status Indicators**
   - Production Job borders and backgrounds should be more opaque when resources are sufficient
   - Production Job borders and backgrounds should be more transparent when resources are insufficient

2. **Enhanced Job Card Information**
   - Display train capacity in Production Job cards
   - Show required resources for delivery and factory jobs
   - Make resource badges clickable to create new jobs at previous levels when insufficient

3. **Eliminate Alert System**
   - Remove the Production Level alert for insufficient resources
   - Replace with integrated visual indicators on individual job cards

4. **Layout Changes**
   - Display Production Jobs horizontally instead of vertically
   - Optimize space utilization and improve visual flow

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Changes**

### **Current System**
- Alert-based resource insufficiency warnings at Production Level
- Vertical job layout
- Limited visual feedback on individual job cards
- Separate resource checking system

### **New System**
- Integrated resource status indicators on job cards
- Horizontal job layout with responsive design
- Real-time visual feedback for resource availability
- Clickable resource badges for quick job creation

## üìö **User Stories**

### **Epic 1: Visual Resource Status System**
**As a** production planner  
**I want** to see at a glance which jobs have sufficient resources  
**So that** I can quickly identify and prioritize resource-constrained tasks

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Job cards show visual opacity changes based on resource sufficiency
- Sufficient resources = more opaque appearance
- Insufficient resources = more transparent appearance
- Changes are immediate and responsive to plan modifications

### **Epic 2: Enhanced Job Information Display**
**As a** production planner  
**I want** to see complete resource requirements and train capacity on each job card  
**So that** I have all necessary information without navigating away

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Train capacity is displayed prominently on job cards
- Required resources are shown with clear visual indicators
- Resource badges are clickable and functional
- Information is organized and easy to read

### **Epic 3: Interactive Resource Management**
**As a** production planner  
**I want** to click on resource badges to create production jobs  
**So that** I can quickly resolve resource shortages

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Clicking insufficient resource badges creates new jobs
- New jobs are automatically placed at previous levels
- Job creation follows existing business logic
- User gets immediate feedback on job creation

### **Epic 4: Horizontal Job Layout**
**As a** production planner  
**I want** jobs to be displayed horizontally  
**So that** I can see more jobs at once and better understand the production flow

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Jobs flow horizontally within each level
- Layout is responsive to different screen sizes
- Drag and drop functionality works in horizontal orientation
- Visual hierarchy is maintained

### **Epic 5: Eliminate Alert System**
**As a** production planner  
**I want** to see resource issues integrated into job cards  
**So that** I don't get overwhelmed with separate warning messages

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- No more Production Level resource insufficiency alerts
- All resource information is contextual to individual jobs
- Clean, uncluttered level headers
- Consistent visual language throughout
